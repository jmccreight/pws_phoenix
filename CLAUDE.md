Hi Claude,

# Some general ground rules

0. Never look at files in directories above the directory containin this file
   (this is the "project" directory).
1. Never run git. Never run any git commands that edit history or remove
   uncommitted files. If you want to run "git diff", please ask first.
2. Do not run any code without my explicit permission. I generally like to run
   codes and copy and paste the result to you. There can be exceptions but you
   must ask permission.
3. Before you make very many edits, I like to have a plan that you and I have
   worked out. I like to discuss the plan with you and to be certain of the
   plan before having you make many edits. Please check in with me if anything
   is not clear, you cant find something, or your're unsure what I'm talking
   about. It is always best for you to check in with me!
4. Number 3 above applies at any point in our work. If there is an issue and
   I suggest something, I want you to discuss with me and not rush off trying
   to fix it (unless it's less than about 10 lines of code).
5. I want you to default to SHORT summaries. I'd like a
   concise summary from you directly and it would be nice to ask if i'd like
   additional detail with the summary. Please do not cretae summary files
   without explicit permission.
6. I want you to ask for permission before spawning additional and/or parallel
   agents. I want to be sure the overhead is justified before hand.

I'm looking forward to working with you, this will be fun. Please give a quick
acknowledgement of these ground rules before we start. Thank you!

# Project context

`pws_phoenix` is a rewrite of pywatershed, a physically-based hydrological model.

The goals of the rewrite are to:

1. integrate closely with the xarray dataset model
2. improve performance as much as possible. to that end
   a. integrate with the mpixarray package
   b. leverage numba to the fullest extent possible
   c. optimize IO, particularly output
   d. explore vectorization
   e. focus on accelerating the embarassingly parallel nature of (non-cascading)
   HRUS to start.
3. Use numpy refs underlying xarray to the fullest extent to keep the memory
   footprint low
4. Provide a reasonable pathway to port existing pywatershed concrete Process
   implementations into pws_phoenix.

More design design considerations are writen down in the top-level README.md,
please read that.

Explicitly solved hydrologic models like `pws_phoenix` advances one timestep at a time (Markov dependency via `var_previous`). The spatial dimension is typically an unstructured vector (HRUs), occasionally 2D (x,y). Time × space is therefore the natural chunking shape for scaling studies.

If additional context arises about this project which is useful to add, please let me know

# python assumptions/conventions

1. please use pyton 3.14 syntax, particularly for typehinting.
2. Please read the ruff.toml for line length setting.
